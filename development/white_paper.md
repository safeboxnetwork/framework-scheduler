# Introduction

## Problem Statement
Data storage, management, accessibility and security are becoming an ever greater challenge in the modern digital age. Traditional data management methods often cannot keep pace with the growing volume of data and complex security requirements. From another perspective, increasingly intensive large-scale corporate services are being built on the accessibility and storage of user data, which often monopolize the market, limiting users’ choices and increasing privacy risks, if not otherwise, then through continuous service fees or the loss of control over the data, for example by using it for data mining purposes.

In addition to the above, more and better-functioning private data storage and management solutions are appearing on the market, whose goal is to give users back control over their data while ensuring its secure storage and accessibility. These solutions often use decentralized systems that enable distributed storage and management of data, thereby reducing dependence on central service providers and increasing data security. However, in most cases operating these solutions requires significant technical knowledge, which limits their wider adoption, and at the same time can endanger security and availability, since their creators basically implement individual services and may not necessarily be able to meet complex data storage or access requirements.
**The Safebox can provide an appropriate solution to this.**

## Why We Need a New Approach

The Safebox solution is not the first attempt to bring together third‑party standalone or community software service initiatives on a manageable platform. It is also not particularly new that a clean, easy‑to‑understand graphical interface continuously supports users in installing and managing services. In fact, there are many similar initiatives, some of which are open source, while others are closed source. These solutions can meet user needs to varying degrees, but they often lack key features that make the Safebox platform unique and efficient, such as a flexible and customizable template system, built‑in domain management, or multiple geo‑redundant backup options. These provide real advantages for users because if a user undertakes to build their own data management infrastructure, it must represent real value for them: it must be configurable and accessible as desired, understandable and easy to use, and it must not expose them to the risk of data loss.

### Remote access

### Multiple georeduntant backups

### 3rd party service management via templates

### Integrated domain management
