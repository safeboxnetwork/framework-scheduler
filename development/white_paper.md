# Introduction

## Problem Statement
Data storage, management, accessibility and security are becoming an ever greater challenge in the modern digital age. Traditional data management methods often cannot keep pace with the growing volume of data and complex security requirements. From another perspective, increasingly intensive large-scale corporate services are being built on the accessibility and storage of user data, which often monopolize the market, limiting users’ choices and increasing privacy risks, if not otherwise, then through continuous service fees or the loss of control over the data, for example by using it for data mining purposes.

In addition to the above, more and better-functioning private data storage and management solutions are appearing on the market, whose goal is to give users back control over their data while ensuring its secure storage and accessibility. These solutions often use decentralized systems that enable distributed storage and management of data, thereby reducing dependence on central service providers and increasing data security. However, in most cases operating these solutions requires significant technical knowledge, which limits their wider adoption, and at the same time can endanger security and availability, since their creators basically implement individual services and may not necessarily be able to meet complex data storage or access requirements.

The Safebox can provide an appropriate solution to this.
