SafeBox / framework-scheduler
Combined Licensing Notice (Version 1.0)

You may choose to use this software under EITHER:
  (A) Mozilla Public License 2.0 (preferred for contributing improvements), OR
  (B) A permissive MIT-style license for unmodified use of the public API surface and example code.

========================================================================
A. Mozilla Public License 2.0
========================================================================
The core source files of framework-scheduler are made available under the MPL 2.0.
Only files you modify or create that are based on MPL-covered files must be shared under MPL 2.0 when distributed.
Unmodified surrounding code, plugins, or separate modules may remain under any license.

Full text (do not remove this link):
https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/

You MUST keep:
  - Copyright notices
  - License reference (this file or a pointer to MPL 2.0)
  - Notices of changes inside changed files (at top or in a CHANGES log)

========================================================================
B. MIT-Style License (for examples, integration stubs, and explicitly marked files)
========================================================================
The files explicitly marked with: 
  SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
are licensed under the following permission notice:

Permission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of those MIT-marked files, subject to including the above SPDX line and this permission notice.

Those MIT-marked files are provided “AS IS”, without warranty of any kind.

========================================================================
PATENTS
========================================================================
Contributors grant a royalty-free patent license to their contributions under the same terms as the chosen option (MPL 2.0 already includes this; MIT-marked files rely on implied patent rights to the extent allowed by law). If you submit code, you affirm you have the right to do so.

========================================================================
TRADEMARK
========================================================================
“SafeBox” trademarks are not licensed. You may describe factual use (e.g., “Built with framework-scheduler”) but not imply endorsement.

========================================================================
HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
========================================================================
1. Fork, modify, keep file-level notices.
2. Add SPDX-License-Identifier: MPL-2.0 to MPL source files you create.
3. For examples or snippets you want maximally permissive, use SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT.
4. Submit a pull request; by doing so you agree your contribution is licensed under the same dual-option scheme.

========================================================================
QUICK SUMMARY (Not a substitute for the licenses)
========================================================================
- Modify core? Share modifications to the modified files (MPL path).
- Build proprietary plugin? Keep it separate; OK under MPL rules.
- Want to copy an example verbatim into closed code? Use MIT-marked files.
- Distribute a product including modified core? Provide source to the modified MPL files.

========================================================================
DISCLAIMER
========================================================================
THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OR LIABILITY, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
